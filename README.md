# Custody Scheduler #

I designed this because there's nothing seemingly like it that takes into account longer time-spans such as months, which is more prevalent now with technology and ease of transporation allowing such a schedule.


* Running
```bash
go build
./goCustody
```

Server will operate on localhost:8080
Visit the webpage and you'll be able to modify the options, for both parents, you can then just generate the schedule and a nice calendar will be outputted.
